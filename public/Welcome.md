# Welcome to Markdown Notes

This is an example note to show how the markdown is rendered in this application.
On the left the markdown editor, and on the right the live preview.
The editor is disabled for this note but you can create and edit your own notes by clicking the "New Note" button in the sidebar.

## Features

- **Live Preview**: See your markdown rendered as you type
- **File Management**: Create, edit, and delete notes
- **Folder Organisation**: Organise your notes in folders
- **Auto-save**: Your changes are automatically saved
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up your editing with handy shortcuts

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The editor supports several helpful keyboard shortcuts to improve your writing experience:

- **Ctrl+S**: Save the current file (shows confirmation message)
- **Ctrl+D**: Duplicate the current line
- **Alt+Shift+↑**: Move the current line up
- **Alt+Shift+↓**: Move the current line down
- **Ctrl+B**: Toggle bold formatting for selected text
- **Ctrl+I**: Toggle italic formatting for selected text

*Note: Auto-save is always active, but Ctrl+S provides reassurance for those who habitually save their work.*

## Markdown Syntax Examples
